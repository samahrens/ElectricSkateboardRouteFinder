# What is this?

This is a route finder meant for electric skateboarding! It's actively under development, but you can use it to find nearby routes to explore on your electric skateboard. More customization options coming soon.

## How to use it

Go to [eskate-route-finder.vercel.app](https://eskate-route-finder.vercel.app) and change the sliders to your preferred distance, then click the button to generate the map.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
